<!-- Project Proposal Information -->
<h2 class="category">Project Proposals</h2>

**Info**

Student members can propose small-scale projects as an opportunity to explore robotics and engineering in meaningful ways. Upon approval by organization leadership the project team can seek funding, technical guidance,equipment and construction space. Projects are meant to encourage the exploration of various engineering disciplines and to provide experience with leadership, groupwork, documentation, and presentation in a technical environment.

**Requirements**

* Up to four students on a project, with one acting as lead
* Submission of written proposal form outlining project details
* Oral design review of project with Mercury leadership

Proposal form must be filled out in full. Consider it an argument as to the validity and usefulness of the project itself. The oral presentation will primarily serve as an overview of design details. It will allow leadership to assess feasibility and address potential problems, as well as to set expectations with the project team.
