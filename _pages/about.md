**Welcome**

Welcome to Oklahoma State University Mercury Robotics! Mercury is an **extracurricular engineering design club**, with an emphasis on **robotics**. Our primary goal is fostering interest and developing competency in robotics and autonomous systems.

Club members collaborate as a design team solving challenging and inter-disciplinary real-world projects. A member's involvement is self-directed, allowing them to work on the aspects of a project interesting or relevant to them.

This site serves as a public face for the club and a **repository of helpful documentation** created by Mercury's own members. This information is meant to help new members familiarize themselves with the numerous elements of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science required for our projects.
