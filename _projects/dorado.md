## Introduction

(paraphrased, add detail later) Design and construction of an autonomous pontoon-style boat with onboard quadrotor capable of landing/taking off from the boat. Initial motivation to seek out the source of an algal bloom by following its gradient in a lake. Goal is to achieve autonomous operation for minimum 8-hour segments, with a "fire and forget" interaction.

## Milestones

* Boat built and floating
* Remote controllable with remote camera feed
* Basic autonomy and sensor readings; logging
* Autonomously tracking algae gradient (or substitute for testing)

## Stretch Goals

* Quadrotor takeoff from stationary boat
* Quadrotor landing on stationary boat
* Quadrotor recharging
* Solar panel attachments
